<h2>Blasted Bounce</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The focus of the game is that players are trying to avoid a deadly bomb to win.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
The use of a bounce mechanic that allows the bomb to move around and get the chance to 
hit players.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
I learned that using Phaser to generate sound is long process. You have to look for sound
files you want then use the phaser methods to implement the sounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
<li>Bomb image: 
<li>Dude image: 
<li>Explosion sound:
<li>Sky image:
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
There are no games that I an think of that closely resemble my game. I am borrowing code 
from the Phaser tutorials as well as the Bounce Knock resource 
<a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/bounce-knock">bounce-knock</a></li>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
Players try to survive and dodge a bouncing bomb where the player touches it
explodes and loses.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li> There are no Storymatic themes I have used

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
The input I am using is keyboard input. The randomness is where the bomb will go next as
it bounces around. The game is basically just a simple 2-player minigame.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
The mechanic the prototype is evaluating is the bouncing mechanic and the moving 
mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
I want players to have fun with each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
Both players can control the characters using arrow keys. The core mechanic of the system
is the bounce system of the bomb where it will bounce around the screen. The first player
moves up down left or right. For player 2, the player moves up with W, left with A, down
with S, and right with D
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
I expect players to find wide open spots where the bomb will be least likely to go.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
The game is abstract. The players are trapped in a small room and only one of them can
escape. The tension is the fact that both players, like the game characters, want to 
avoid getting killed from the bomb. It is essentially a video game version of a
Saw movie trap.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
I'm trying to reach everyone of all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
The game will last until one of the players dies by touching the bomb.
