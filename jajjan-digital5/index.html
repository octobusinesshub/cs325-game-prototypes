<h2>Greasiness Stakes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
You are running backwards and trying to crash into obstacles rather than avoid them.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
The interesting about my game technology is the collision between the pig and the objects.
For a fun cartoon-like effect.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
I learned about how to make a side-scrolling game. The hardest part of making the game
was trying to make the items to collide with each other. I was thinking of making them
immovable for a different game, but then decided to switch to the concept I have now.
The easiest part was setting up where the barricades would appear on the screen
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
The game most likely resembles a reverse version of Flappy bird where you are crashing 
into items instead of avoiding them.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
You control a pig to crash into as many obstacles as you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
I used the Storymatic theme of pig.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
I used the arrow key input. The randomness is when the obstacles in the game come to the
pig in a side-scrolling genre. The play style is similar to that of a 2D shooter except
you have to push the objects out of the way.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
The prototype is evaluating the collision game mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
I want players to have a fun and silly time destroying obstacles out of the way while
controlling a pig.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
A player can control the pig using the arrow keys. The game has a bouncing mechanic 
where as the pig pushes harder into the obstacle, the easier it is for the obstacle to
be moved in the direction
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
The more the pig moves in to the obstacle, the easier it is for the obstacles to 
be pushed.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
The game is set in a sporting event for pigs. The pig, named Charles Webber, an aspiring
pig who hopes to be legendary sports pig. The player will control the pig in many levels
in hopes of helping Charles win the Royal Hog Trophy. The tension is connected through how
the player, like Charles doesn't want to mess up (in this case not miss any obstacles)
in any of the races throughout the Greasiness Stakes in order to accomplish the same 
goal of winning the competition.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
I am trying to reach the demographic for players aged 8-13.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
The game will go on forever for now, but I could include conditions for the game to stop.
</li>
