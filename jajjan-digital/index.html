I am borrowing code from a Phaser Example

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
I want my players to have the experience shooting everything on sight at a high speed.
I also want my players to be invested in the story.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
The player can control their robot with the arrow keys to move around. When a player 
pushes the up button, robot will move up.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
The player should aim wisely to get a high score. Poor aiming means a low score for the 
game. Chaining combos will be implemented in the game later on. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
The world is a robot society where a dictator rules it's citizens with an iron fist. The
hero in the story is Blitz, a rebelling robot. Blitz is distraught by the tyranny of the
regime and plans to put a stop to that. Using his blaster, Blitz will shoot his way to 
freedom for the robots. The game world and occupants are unique because the premise is a 
robot rebelling against an evil robot regime.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
The demographic I am trying to reach are kids and teens(ages 7-18)
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
For the sake of demonstation, the game will take 5 minutes to play. There will be levels
as I work on the game so the game could take like an hour when finished.
