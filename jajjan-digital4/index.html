<h2>Mathematical Maze</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
You are escaping a maze by solving basic math problems.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
You are using math skills to help you escape the maze.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
I learned of adding image signs and adding sound into the game, which was also the  
hardest part. Sometimes, the
music would play upon startup. Other times, the music would play. The easiest part was 
creating a tile map from scratch. It was fun using a variety of tiles to create a unique
map.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
I made my tile map, number signs, and expression signs from scratch

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
My game resembles any educational game escape where you learn by escaping from a maze.
Some of the code borrows elements from the Phaser tutorial game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
Players use their basic math knowledge to escape from a maze.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
I used the Storymatic themes of escape and scholar.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
I used the arrow key input. The genre is essentially a puzzle game as you are solving
problems to escape from a maze. The play style is essentially just a simple educational
2D game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
The game mechanic is evaluating the basic movement mechanic
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
I want players to feel the thrill of escaping while also being able to learn about math.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
The player can basically move around using the arrow keys. The arrow key direction the
player pushes is the same direction the player moves in. The signs show the problem when
there are two or more paths and a solution for each path. The correct solution is the
correct path the player is taking. Even though the current maze is aimed for elementary 
school kids, I might include more advanced problems to make it more suitable for advanced
 grade levels and make the player more likely to go in the wrong maze path.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Players must use their knowledge of math to excel at playing this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
The game focuses on a person who is trapped in a maze. The only way to escape the maze
is to figure out problems scattered throughout the maze. The player hopes to escape the
maze while through figuring out math problems scattered throughout the maze. The dramatic
tension interacts with the gameplay tension through the player hoping they guessed the 
right answer after choosing the answer path.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
My current demographic varies on the skill level of the questions. My current maze is 
reaching for elementary school students.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
Currently, there is only a small maze, which takes about a few minutes to accomplish.
