<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
Players try to pass one final physical exam before they're officially free from school.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
I used the Storymatic theme of last day of school.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
I used the platforming genre. The input wil just be the arrow keys, where the up arrow
key is used to jump and the left and right arrow keys are used to move.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
The game mechanic that is being evaluated is the menu, preload, and game over stage 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
I just want the player to have fun
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
The player would have just raced across the hallway while collecting all the items before
time would run out. The controls would just be basic left-right movement and jumping. 
There also would have been obstacles to obstruct the player from winning such as falling 
apples. The obstacles would have also hurt the player as there are plans for a health
system in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
The player just has to be able to control the in collecting the items.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
You just control a student who is trying to finally finish the school year and look
forward to summer break. However, you must complete a final physical exam before you can
enjoy summer break. The player can relate to the character as they look forward to days
of freedom from school. The player wants the character to experience a relaxing summer
as the player collects the stars.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
I'm trying to reach the demographic of 8-12 age group.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
The game lasts until the player collects all the stars.
